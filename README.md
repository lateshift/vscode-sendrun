### This is probably -NOT- the extension you are looking for!

It only sends "run &lt;filename&gt;" into the Terminal (which should be already running IPython ðŸ¤–).

### Why?

I just need to execute some Python script without reimporting (thanks IPython) all modules (Yo IFCOpenshell ðŸ‘‹).

### But I -really- want to use this ...

Well ... just launch IPython first and execute the command "sendTextToIPyTerm" (= "Send to IPython instance").

### Improvements?

Mhm â€¦ Nope.

### Why not Jupyter?

Go away â€¦

### Anything else?

Nope. See you on the other side â€¦
